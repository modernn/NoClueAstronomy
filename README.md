## Features

* **Location-based Event Tracking**

  Users can view upcoming astronomical events specific to their location.
* **Event Details**

  Information on the date, time, and visibility conditions for each event.
* **Scalable Architecture**

  Modular design for easy future enhancements (e.g., notifications, star maps, AR views).
